Solutions for Cracking the Coding Interview 6th ed. 

Cracking the Coding Interview is one of the most prolific books on the subject of well.. passing coding interviews. It contains hundreds of pages worth of interview-style problems. I'm going to try to get one question done per day in the hopes that the next time I do an interview, I'll be better prepared for it. In any case, it's still just good practice, so can't hurt to do them!
